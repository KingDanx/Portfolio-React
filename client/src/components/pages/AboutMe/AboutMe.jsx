          I have over 11 years of troubleshooting and problem-solving
          experience. I see myself as a partner rather than an employee.
          Meaning, I feel the success of the company I work with is directly
          tied to the product and accomplishments I provide to the company. I am
          a dedicated, focused, and punctual individual that will not accept
          failure on my behalf.

          I am an addict of programming. Whether I’m looking at a website, a
          piece of electronic equipment, or a toy, all I can think about is what
          technologies, loops, arrays, or conditionals went into creating its
          behavior. I will frequently find myself programing my own projects for
          hours on end without realizing a moment has passed. Solving a problem
          that previously seemed impossible gives me an abundance of thrill,
          fulfillment, and motivation to continue.

    //   <h2>Three Words About My Professional Qualities</h2>
    //   <div>
    //     Persistent: When presented with a problem I do not give up until I find
    //     some kind of solution. There are so many ways to solve problems and I
    //     will break down my issue and attack from every angle until I have a
    //     viable solution to my problem or until I make it a non-problem. Humble:
    //     I am not afraid of humility or being wrong. I enjoy constructive
    //     criticism and consider the advice given to me. I believe the moment we
    //     are right about everything we will no longer be on the frontier of
    //     innovation. Philomath: I have a passion for learning. I believe
    //     receiving mentorship is invaluable. I spend a minimum of three hours a
    //     day listening or watching educational content, from programming to
    //     astrophysics, to anthropology, and much more.
    //   </div>
    //   <h2>Three Words That Describe The Best Role For Me</h2>
    //   <div>
    //     Challenging: I am a natural problem solver and I am ready and willing to
    //     take on the complex task my team assigns to me. Meaningful: I want my
    //     work to be fulfilling. I want to develop exceptional products that are
    //     easy to use, understand, and better the lives of consumers. Growth: I
    //     want to be in a position where I can absorb knowledge from my mentors
    //     and peers. I am eager to learn and grow as a developer to make the best
    //     products I am capable of creating.
