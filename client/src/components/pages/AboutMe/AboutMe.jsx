                    I have over 11 years of troubleshooting and problem-solving
                    experience. I see myself as a partner rather than an employee.
                    Meaning, I feel the success of the company I work with is directly
                    tied to the product and accomplishments I provide to the company. I am
                    a dedicated, focused, and punctual individual that will not accept
                    failure on my behalf.

                    I am an addict of programming. Whether I’m looking at a website, a
                    piece of electronic equipment, or a toy, all I can think about is what
                    technologies, loops, arrays, or conditionals went into creating its
                    behavior. I will frequently find myself programing my own projects for
                    hours on end without realizing a moment has passed. Solving a problem
                    that previously seemed impossible gives me an abundance of thrill,
                    fulfillment, and motivation to continue!

                        Persistent: When presented with a problem I do not give up until I
                        find some kind of solution. There are so many ways to solve problems
                        and I will break down my issue and attack from every angle until I
                        have a viable solution to my problem or until I make it a
                        non-problem.

                    <p>
                        Humble: I am not afraid of humility or being wrong. I enjoy
                        constructive criticism and consider the advice given to me. I
                        believe the moment we are right about everything we will no longer
                        be on the frontier of innovation.

                        Philomath: I have a passion for learning. I believe receiving
                        mentorship is invaluable. I spend a minimum of three hours a day
                        listening or watching educational content, from programming to
                        astrophysics, to anthropology, and much more.
